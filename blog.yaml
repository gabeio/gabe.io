	title: "LiveScript my new Coffeescript"
	content: |
		Wrote a small tutorial of LiveScript + Expressjs on <a href="http://runnable.com/me/U-sxm8m9AJtCfCdI">runnable</a>.
		Just incase you didn't know what <a href="http://LiveScript.net">LiveScript</a> was, it's a beautifully designed language
		which allows for so much more elegance than either javascript or coffeescript could manage. It allows for backcalls,
		for loops of lists,objects, and only run the loop when x is true. Just a simply amazing language I just have fallen in love with.

    Just a quick entry to say hi again to my friends who actually visit my little site here.
    I am happy to say that I have had enough time to put together a really quick and dirty blog
    It's not really anything serious just trying to get some traffic again.
