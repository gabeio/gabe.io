  title: "Sometimes you just think it won't work"
  content: |
    I don't know about the rest of the coders out there but, I am still trying to improve my understanding of computer
    languages as a whole. With this comes understanding, of corse, and these weird moments when I stop writing a line
    for a second and go "is this really going to work", then continue on to think when it does, "it actually was that
    simple.". I guess after years of coding it's nice to be able to actually get things done you want to get done instead
    of having to keep tinkering with it continuously until it finally works. This blog for example just amazed me in many
    different ways. It's amazing how small the code for this blog actually is. And the speed potential behind it is quite
    amazing also.

  title: "LiveScript my new Coffeescript"
  content: |
    Wrote a small tutorial of LiveScript + Expressjs on <a href="http://runnable.com/me/U-sxm8m9AJtCfCdI">runnable</a>.
    Just incase you didn't know what <a href="http://LiveScript.net">LiveScript</a> was, it's a beautifully designed language
    which allows for so much more elegance than either javascript or coffeescript could manage. It allows for backcalls,
    <code>for</code> loops <code>of</code> lists, objects, and only run the loop <code>when</code> x is true. Just a simply
    amazing language I just have fallen in love with.

  title: "the Beginning"
  content: |
    Just a quick entry to say hi again to my friends who actually visit my little site here.
    I am happy to say that I have had enough time to put together a really quick and dirty blog
    It's not really anything serious just trying to get some traffic again.
