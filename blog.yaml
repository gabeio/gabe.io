  title: "An Education Platform"
  content: |
    I have slowly been working on improving a small app I built for my senior project class though it was as much for the class as it was
    for me. It is my attempt to replace Blackboard which has been my most loathed education platform (and only one I have had the misfortune of using).
    I, being a student personally, think I would be a better candidate for creating an education platform.
    Though I haven't had input from any teachers yet but will absolutely enjoy their oppinions.
    It will include many things like push notifications for updates to courses you are presently taking,
    direct messaging so teachers can talk directly to students outside the class room and faster than email,
    a forum area (one level) allowing students to ask questions and have other students or teachers answer,
    a blog area for teachers to directly push updates/info to students without extra clutter like comments
    from other students which should be addressed withing the forum area and so much more!

  title: "Camp Fatima of NJ"
  content: |
    I have been helping out at this organization for a very long time (14 years). In that time I have seen a ton of people
    come and go, and not even close to as many people stay. I have to say that I am thankful that my parents were the ones
    to bring me here, and I have continued the tradition and expanded on it by not only attending the weekends but also attending
    the summer camp. When I heard how much it was to run camp each year I was astonished, and how much they were collecting
    was a scary difference. Which is why I have come to the internet to ask for help from anyone who uses amazon. Amazon Smile
    is Amazon's way of giving back to organizations like ours and really helping make it happen. If anyone is interested in
    helping please go <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/charity/about.html/ref=smi_se_uds_learn_saas">here to Amazon Smile</a>
    and choose Camp Fatima of NJ. And when ever you shop on Amazon go to Amazon Smile and when you purchase anything it will
    be helping us keep camp up and running.

  title: "Sometimes you just think it won't work"
  content: |
    I don't know about the rest of the coders out there but, I am still trying to improve my understanding of computer
    languages as a whole. With this comes understanding, of corse, and these weird moments when I stop writing a line
    for a second and go "is this really going to work", then continue on to think when it does, "it actually was that
    simple.". I guess after years of coding it's nice to be able to actually get things done you want to get done instead
    of having to keep tinkering with it continuously until it finally works. This blog for example just amazed me in many
    different ways. It's amazing how small the code for this blog actually is. And the speed potential behind it is quite
    amazing also.

  title: "LiveScript my new Coffeescript"
  content: |
    Wrote a small tutorial of LiveScript + Expressjs on <a href="http://runnable.com/U-BNRWxYIUI1kA6M" data-ignore="push">runnable</a>.
    Just incase you didn't know what <a href="http://LiveScript.net" data-ignore="push">LiveScript</a> was, it's a beautifully designed language
    which allows for so much more elegance than either javascript or coffeescript could manage. It allows for backcalls,
    <code>for</code> loops <code>of</code> lists, objects, and only run the loop <code>when</code> x is true. Just a simply
    amazing language I just have fallen in love with.

  title: "the Beginning"
  content: |
    Just a quick entry to say hi again to my friends who actually visit my little site here.
    I am happy to say that I have had enough time to put together a really quick and dirty blog.
    It's not really anything serious just trying to get some traffic again.
